CSE202-Programming Languages Student project: __Higher-Order__ Functions

## How to submit your assignments 
First fork this repository on GitHub to create your own __private__ copy of the repository (Using GitHub web interface).
Create a new branch with the name your **studentid** and set this branch default.
Then you can clone your own copy of the repository to your computer.

On your copy of the repository create a directory with your **studentid**. All your work must be inside this directory.

When working on the project, `git commit` every stage of your development with a meaningful commit message.
This is important for me to see your effort.

When you finish the project, submit your assignments by creating a **pull request** from your forked repository to the original template repository (Using GitHub web interface).
You can also do further pull requests after your first pull request.

Do not `git push` directly to this template repository. Only do pull requests.

## Requirements:

1. Function Design: Design __5__ higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results i.e:

    - `map`: A function that applies a given function to each element of a list and returns a new list containing the results.
    - `filter`: A function that selects only the elements of a list that satisfy a given predicate and returns a new list containing those elements.
    - `reduce`: A function that combines the elements of a list using a given operator and returns a single result.
    - `compose`: A function that takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that applies the second function to the result of the first function.

    **Each function is 5 points**.

2.  Function Implementation: Implement the higher-order functions using functional programming techniques.
    You can use any programming language.
    The code should be well-organized and well-documented, with clear explanations of each function and algorithm used.    
    **Each function is 5 points**.

3.  Test Cases: Write a set of test cases to verify the correctness of their functions. 
    The test cases should cover different scenarios and edge cases, such as empty lists, large lists, and functions that return error conditions.
    **Each function is 5 points**.

4.  Report: Write a short report in markdown format (this document format) or plain text format in your directory describing your functions and how they work. 
    The report should include a discussion of the functional programming techniques used to implement the functions, as well as any challenges or difficulties they faced.
    **Each function is 5 points**.
